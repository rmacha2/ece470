The Great Goalie

This repository is used for submission of the final project for ECE470. This robot is made to stop balls shot at the goal. The files for this robot can be seen in "submissions" folder and the world can be loaded from "worlds/Submissions.wbt". Our code uses an external library called ikpy which is used for figuring out the inverse kinematics of the UR10 robot.
